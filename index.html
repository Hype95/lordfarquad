        <H1>Hello Shrek</H1>
        <p>FARQUAAD: (stepping forward) That's enough. He's ready to talk.

            The Gingerbread Man is pulled out of the milk by Thelonious and is slammed down onto a cookie sheet. Farquaad manically laughs as he walks over to the table. When he reaches the table we see that he is too short to see above it. He clears his throat and the table is lowered.
            
            FARQUAAD: (he picks up the Gingy's severed legs and plays with them) Run, run, run, as fast as you can. You can't catch me. I'm the gingerbread man!
            
            GINGY: You're a monster!
            
            FARQUAAD: I'm not the monster here, you are. (throws one leg at Gingy) You and the rest of that fairy tale trash, poisoning my perfect world (crumbles his other leg into dust). Now, tell me! Where are the others?!
            
            GINGY: Eat me! (He spits milk into Farquaad's eye.)
            
            FARQUAAD: I've tried to be fair to you creatures. Now my patience has reached its end! Tell me or I'll...(he grabs one of Gingy's gumdrop buttons)
            
            GINGY: No, no, not the buttons. Not my gumdrop buttons!
            
            FARQUAAD: All right then. Who's hiding them?
            
            GINGY: Okay, I'll tell you. Do you know the muffin man?
            
            FARQUAAD: The muffin man?
            
            GINGERBREAD MAN: The muffin man.
            
            FARQUAAD: Yes, I know the muffin man, who lives on Drury Lane?
            
            GINGERBREAD MAN: Well, she's married to the muffin man.
            
            FARQUAAD: (Shocked) The muffin man?
            
            GINGERBREAD MAN: The muffin man!
            
            FARQUAAD: She's married to the muffin man...
            
            A door opens and the Captain of the Duloc Guards steps in.
            
            CAPTAIN: My lord! We've found it.
            
            FARQUAAD: Then what are you waiting for? Bring it in!
            
            More guards enter carrying an object covered by a sheet. They mount it on the wall and the Captain removes the sheet. It is the Magic Mirror. Everyone stands in awe.
            
            GINGERBREAD MAN: Ohhhh...</p>
